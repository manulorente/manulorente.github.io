    <span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
    I began my career at <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledyne_Anafocus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Anafocus</b></a>, 
    working on image sensors, designing tests, and automating measurements for characterization. Later, after the company acquisition by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledyne_Technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Teledyne Technologies</b></a>,
    I moved abroad to join <a href="https://imaging.teledyne-e2v.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Teledyne-e2v</b></a>, 
    where I focused on camera middleware and system development. Currently, as Application Engineer I manage technical support, product development, and client relationships. My work involves coding PoCs, creating APIs, implementing CI/CD, training customers, and helping them with the integration and success of our products.

    <span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
    Obtained my degree in <a href="https://etsi.us.es/estudios-y-titulaciones/grados/grado-en-ingenieria-de-las-tecnologias-de-telecomunicacion/plan-de-estudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Telecommunications Engineering</b></a> at the University of Seville, and balancing my studies with national rowing competitions. After deciding to focus on my career, I applied to the semiconductor industry filling the space that competitive rowing had left in my life and completing my degree. Later, I started a Master in <a href="https://www.masterseeiuma.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Electronics and Embedded Systems</b></a> at University of Malaga, to bridge knowledge gaps in electronics, particularly in embedded systems and low-level programming. This motivated me into software roles, leading me to a second Master in <a href="https://www.codeurjc.es/mastercloudapps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Cloud Native Applications Development</b></a> at the University Rey Juan Carlos where I delved into cloud computing, microservices, and DevOps culture.
