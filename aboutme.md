<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I have always been fascinated by the concept of being a "Full-Stack Engineer." During my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering, I constantly wondered how to achieve this. I realized that it involves learning backend technologies, mastering database management, and acquiring frontend skills. But, what about the hardware?
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    When I started my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering at the University of Seville, I was excited about subjects like electronics, semiconductors, programming, and Linux. This enthusiasm led me to begin my professional career in the semiconductor industry while finishing my degree in 2015.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I believed that understanding the entire product development process, from hardware design to software development, was crucial for being a successful engineer. This belief has driven me to continuously learn about all aspects of product development. It also inspired me to pursue a Master's degree in Electronics and Embedded Systems at the University of Malaga. I felt that I needed more knowledge about hardware, PCB design, signal integrity, FPGA design, kernels, and real-time systems to excel in my role in the semiconductor industry.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    After completing my Master's degree, one thing became clear: I wanted to be a true Full-Stack Engineer, not only in the hardware world but also in the software domain. To achieve this, I revisited old books on Linux and programming and started learning about web development, databases, design patterns, and more. I wasn't focused on mastering any specific programming language, but rather on understanding concepts, design patterns, commonly used libraries, and algorithms.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    This journey led me to the world of cloud computing, DevOps culture, and software design, which fascinated me. To deepen my knowledge, I joined the <a href="https://svqtech.com/comunidades/cloud-native-sevilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Native Sevilla</a> community, where I could learn from the best professionals in the field. I also began studying Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and more. This prompted me to enroll in another Master's degree in Cloud Computing and DevOps at the University of Rey Juan Carlos. While I could have learned all of this on my own, I wanted a structured, organized, and evaluated approach to gain solid knowledge, especially since I was working full-time and needed a schedule to follow.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    My current career goal is to further specialize in IT, focusing on Linux, DevOps, and cloud technologies. To this end, I have earned certifications in 
    Linux (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-it-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LFCA</a>), 
    AWS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Practitioner</a>), 
    and Azure (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fundamentals</a>). 
    I am currently preparing for more advanced certifications in 
    Linux (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LFCS</a>), 
    Kubernetes (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-cloud-native-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KCNA</a>,
                <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CKAD</a>,
                <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CKA</a>), 
    and AWS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solutions Architect Associate</a>,
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Associate</a>). 
    I believe these certifications will provide me with a solid and deeper knowledge, building on the experience I have gained over the years.

    Now, I feel I am closer to the concept of a true Full-Stack Engineer, or as I like to call it, a "Full Engineer." This is why I decided to start this blog: to share my knowledge, experiences, and projects, and to help others achieve their goals. Additionally, this blog serves as a personal record and guide for myself, as I tend to forget things, and I believe it will help me consolidate my knowledge and experiences.

## My Story

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I began my career as a characterization engineer at a well-established startup, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledyne_Anafocus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anafocus</a>, where I was responsible for characterizing the image sensors the company was developing. My role involved designing test boards, developing test software, analyzing data, and writing reports. I focused on sensor characterization, automating measurements and analyzing data with Matlab, and Python, and communicating with the design team to improve the product.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    After completing my Engineering degree, I had the opportunity to temporarily move abroad and join our parent company, <a href="https://imaging.teledyne-e2v.com/products/standard-image-sensors/cmos-standard-image-sensors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e2v</a>, in France and China. During these two stays in 2017 and 2018, I learned a great deal about system design, C++ drivers, Python APIs for cameras middleware, and customer end-applications as part of the sales and application team.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    Currently, I am an application engineer at the same company, now part of Teledyne, in the North American division of Teledyne-e2v, based in Denver, Colorado. My responsibilities include applications and technical support, with a focus on business development, customer relationships, and product management. I also develop drivers, APIs for proof of concepts and demos, write technical documentation, train the sales team, and provide technical presales and postsales support to customers.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I have always strived to maintain a balanced life. Outside of my professional career, I am passionate about sports, particularly rowing, which I have practiced since I was 14 years old. I have competed in several national and international championships, but now I take advantage of the US mountains to enjoy trail running, hiking, and snowboarding.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    ... and always learning, always improving, always growing. I look forward to new challenges to continue feeding the Full Engineer inside me.
