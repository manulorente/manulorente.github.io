<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I've always been fascinated by the concept of "Full-Stack Engineer." During my Bachelor's in Telecommunications Engineering at the University of Seville, I often wondered what that meant and what it would take to achieve it. I soon realized that it involved not just system and backend software technologies, and frontend skills, but also hardware knowledge.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    During my time at the University of Seville, I dove deep into electronics, and programming while I tried to balance my studies with my passion for rowing. I was competing nationally and internationally, and I learned a lot about discipline, hard work, and perseverance. I realized that to be successful in any field, you need to be dedicated, focused, and always open to learn.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    Unfortunately, I had to make a tough decision and leave rowing behind to focus on my studies. But I needed to fill the gap that rowing left in my life, so I focused on finding a job and start my career as soon as possible. I started working in the semiconductor industry while finishing my degree in 2015, balancing work and studies. That's when I realized that to be a successful engineer, you need to understand the entire product development process, from hardware design to software development. This belief motivated me to continuously learn about all aspects of product development.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I felt that the more I studied, the more I realized there was to learn. And I decided to enroll a Master's degree in Electronics and Embedded Systems at the University of Malaga because I felt a lack of knowledge from my degree in many fields such as hardware, PCB design, signal integrity, FPGA design, and real-time systems to excel in the semiconductors industry.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    After completing my Master's degree, one thing was clear: I wanted to continue expanding my engineering skills and become a true Full-Stack Engineer, not just in hardware, but also in software. To do this, I revisited old Linux and programming books and started diving into system design, data structures, databases, design patterns, and more. I wasn't focused on mastering any specific new fancy programming language but on understanding concepts, common data structures, and algorithms.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    This journey brought me to the world of cloud computing, DevOps culture, and system design, which fascinated me. To deepen my knowledge, I joined the <a href="https://svqtech.com/comunidades/cloud-native-sevilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Native Sevilla</a> community, what motivated me to enroll in another master, in this case about Cloud Native Applications Development at the University of Rey Juan Carlos. While I could have learned all of this on my own, I wanted a structured and evaluated approach, especially since It was difficult following it while working full-time and needed some schedule and organization.
</p>

### My Career Goals

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I have been working in the software industry for over 10 years now. On a variety of projects, from small to large, from simple to complex, and with a variety of technologies, from low-level programming to high-level programming, but mainly focused on embedded systems.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    Now, after all these years, I have decided to change my focus from embedded systems to software and cloud system design. I have always been interested in software development and system design, but I have never had the opportunity to work on these areas. So I took the decision some time ago to study some certifications in AWS, Kubernetes or Linux and complete all the academic knowledge I had with practical experience. My idea was to masterize in several verticals: IT, cloud computing, Linux, Kubernetes, AWS, business strategies, and software development. 
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    To this end, I have earned certifications in 
    Linux (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-it-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LFCA</a>),
    AWS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Practitioner</a>),
    and Azure (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fundamentals</a>).
    I am currently preparing for more advanced certifications in 
    Linux (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LFCS</a>),
    Kubernetes (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-cloud-native-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KCNA</a>,
                <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CKAD</a>,
                <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CKA</a>),
    and AWS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solutions Architect Associate</a>,
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Associate</a>).
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I believe these certifications will give me a solid and deeper knowledge, building on the experience I have gained over the years.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    Now, I feel like I'm closer to the concept of a true Full-Stack Engineer, or as I like to call it, a "Full Engineer." That's why I decided to start this site: to share my knowledge and experiences, and to help others achieve their goals. On the other hand, it serves as a personal record and guide for myself, as I tend to forget things, and writing about the most interesting ones helps me internalize everything. It is well-known that we typically learn 10% of what we read, 30% when we discuss, and 90% when we teach others.
</p>

### My Story

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I started my career as a characterization engineer at a well-established startup, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledyne_Anafocus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anafocus</a>, where I was responsible for characterizing the image sensors the company was developing. My role involved designing test boards, developing test software, analyzing data, and writing reports. I focused on sensor characterization, automating measurements and analyzing data with Matlab, and Python, and communicating with the design team to refine products.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    After completing my Engineering degree, I had the opportunity to temporarily move abroad and join our parent company, <a href="https://imaging.teledyne-e2v.com/products/standard-image-sensors/cmos-standard-image-sensors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e2v</a>, n France and China, where I focused on systems, camera middleware, and customer-facing applications. These experiences taught me a lot about drivers, C++, and Python APIs, pushing me toward more software-oriented roles.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    Today, I’m an Application Engineer at Teledyne, in Denver, Colorado, managing technical support, product development, and customer relationships. I’m heavily involved in coding drivers, writing documentation, creating APIs for demos, and helping customers solve complex problems using our products. This role has always been a great opportunity to develop business strategies and contribute to product management.
</p>

### Why This Blog?

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    Since I have developed software for a long time, C, C++, Python, Java, etc. But sometimes, among some frameworks, I have lost the big picture. So I will gather all my insights and experiences in this blog and try refresh the basis: data structures, algorithms, design patterns, software architectures, good practices, etc.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    This site is my space to share everything I’m learning—whether it's DevOps, cloud computing, or system design. It’s a place to document my projects, explore new tech, and help others with practical insights. Plus, writing about what I learn helps me cement it all. Think of it as the best way to documentate my journey in this refreshment of my career.
</p>

</p>

### Outside of Tech

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I have always strived to maintain a balanced life. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors. Since I left the high-performance rowing, I try to stay active every day whether it’s rowing as my hobby, running, hiking, or snowboarding in the Rockies
</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/aboutme/aboutme_3.jpg" alt="Me snowboarding" width="466" height="350">
