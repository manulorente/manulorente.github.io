    I've always been fascinated by the concept of "Full-Stack Engineer." During my Bachelor's in Telecommunications Engineering at the University of Seville, I often wondered what that meant and what it would take to achieve it. I soon realized that it involved not just system and backend software technologies, and frontend skills, but also hardware knowledge.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I remember that while studying for my final assignments in my third year, I was thrilled by subjects like electronics, semiconductors, programming, and Linux. Since I realized I couldn't make a living from high-level sports, I knew I had to carve out my own future through studying and working in the 'real world.' So, I decided to find a tech company where I could develop all the engineering skills I was learning so I began my professional career in the semiconductor industry while finishing my degree in 2015.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    During my first years juggling my studies and my job, I believed that to be a successful engineer, you need to understand the entire product development process, from hardware design to software development. This belief motivated me to continuously learn about all aspects of product development. I felt that the more I studied, the more I realized there was to learn. And I decided to enroll a Master's degree in Electronics and Embedded Systems at the University of Malaga because I felt a lack of knowledge from my degree in hardware, PCB design, signal integrity, FPGA design, kernels, and real-time systems to excel in the semiconductor industry.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    After completing my Master's degree, one thing was clear: I wanted to continue expanding my engineering skills and become a true Full-Stack Engineer, not just in hardware, but also in software. To do this, I revisited old Linux and programming books and started diving into system design, data structures, databases, design patterns, and more. I wasn't focused on mastering any specific additional programming language but on understanding concepts, common data structures, libraries, and algorithms.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    This journey brought me to the world of cloud computing, DevOps culture, and system design, which captivated me. To deepen my knowledge, I joined the <a href="https://svqtech.com/comunidades/cloud-native-sevilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Native Sevilla</a> community, where I learned from top professionals in the field. This motivated me to enroll in another master, in this case about Cloud Computing and DevOps at the University of Rey Juan Carlos. While I could have learned all of this on my own, I wanted a structured and evaluated approach, especially since It was difficult following it while working full-time and needed some schedule and organization.

    My current career goal is to further specialize in IT, focusing on Linux, DevOps, and cloud technologies. To this end, I have earned certifications in 
    Linux (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-it-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LFCA</a>),
    AWS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Practitioner</a>),
    and Azure (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fundamentals</a>).
    I am currently preparing for more advanced certifications in 
    Linux (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LFCS</a>),
    Kubernetes (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-cloud-native-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KCNA</a>,
                <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CKAD</a>,
                <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CKA</a>),
    and AWS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solutions Architect Associate</a>,
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Associate</a>).
    I believe these certifications will give me a solid and deeper knowledge, building on the experience I have gained over the years.

    Now, I feel like I'm closer to the concept of a true Full-Stack Engineer, or as I like to call it, a "Full Engineer." That's why I decided to start this site: to share my knowledge and experiences, and to help others achieve their goals. Additionally, it serves as a personal record and guide for myself, as I tend to forget things, and writing about the most interesting ones helps me internalize everything. It is well-known that we typically learn 10% of what we read, 30% when we discuss, and 90% when we teach others.

## My Story

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I started my career as a characterization engineer at a well-established startup, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledyne_Anafocus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anafocus</a>, where I was responsible for characterizing the image sensors the company was developing. My role involved designing test boards, developing test software, analyzing data, and writing reports. I focused on sensor characterization, automating measurements and analyzing data with Matlab, and Python, and communicating with the design team to improve the product.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    After completing my Engineering degree, I had the opportunity to temporarily move abroad and join our parent company, <a href="https://imaging.teledyne-e2v.com/products/standard-image-sensors/cmos-standard-image-sensors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e2v</a>, in France and China. During these two stays in 2017 and 2018, I learned a great deal about system design, C++ drivers, Python APIs for cameras middleware, and customer end-applications as part of the sales and application team.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    Currently, I am an application engineer at the same company, now acquired by Teledyne, in the North American division, based in Denver, Colorado. My responsibilities include applications and technical support, with a focus on business development, customer relationships, and product management. I also develop drivers, APIs for proof of concepts and demos, write technical documentation, train the sales team, and provide technical presales and postsales support to customers.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I have always strived to maintain a balanced life. Outside of my professional career, I am passionate about f√∫tbol and sports, particularly rowing, which I have practiced since I was 14 years old. I have had the pleasure of competing in several national and international championships, making many friends around the world. Nowadays, rowing is one of my hobbies, and I take advantage of the US mountains to enjoy trail running, hiking, and snowboarding in the Rockies!

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    ... and always learning, always improving, always growing. I look forward to new challenges to continue feeding the Full Engineer inside me.
