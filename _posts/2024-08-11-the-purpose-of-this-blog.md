## The purpose of this blog

This blog is a hodgepodge of programming, software development and system design. My idea is to write about some topics that interest me, and be used to record my refreshers on some computer science concepts.

I will be writing about data structures, algorithms, software design patterns, system design, and computer science concepts. Including some examples and code snippets in Python, TypeScript, or Go will help me to understand the concepts better and make it more engaging since are the languages I use the most.

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it.
